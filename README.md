# fabric file to upgrade Nagios
#
# This fabfile was based on instructions below and we tested only with Nagios Core version 4
# https://assets.nagios.com/downloads/nagioscore/docs/nagioscore/4/en/upgrading.html
#
# We assume that Nagios installation is on /usr/local/nagios
# Otherwise edit this fabfile accordingly.
#
# Shell script to backup_nagios is also needed and it is available along with fabfile.
# Any suggestions to improve this fabfile to upgrade Nagios Core installation is very welcome.
